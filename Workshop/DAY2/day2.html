        A well-organized paragraph supports or develops a single controlling idea, which is expressed in a sentence
        called the topic sentence. A topic sentence has several important functions: it substantiates or supports an
        essay’s thesis statement; it unifies the content of a paragraph and directs the order of the sentences; and it
        advises the reader of the subject to be discussed and how the paragraph will discuss it. Readers generally look
        to the first few sentences in a paragraph to determine the subject and perspective of the paragraph. That’s why
        it’s often best to put the topic sentence at the very beginning of the paragraph. In some cases, however, it’s
        more effective to place another sentence before the topic sentence—for example, a sentence linking the current
        paragraph to the previous one, or one providing background information.

        Although most paragraphs should have a topic sentence, there are a few situations when a paragraph might not
        need a topic sentence. For example, you might be able to omit a topic sentence in a paragraph that narrates a
        series of events, if a paragraph continues developing an idea that you introduced (with a topic sentence) in the
        previous paragraph, or if all the sentences and details in a paragraph clearly refer—perhaps indirectly—to a
        main point. The vast majority of your paragraphs, however, should have a topic sentence.

        SCIENTISTS HAVE LEARNED TO SUPPLEMENT THE SENSE OF SIGHT IN NUMEROUS WAYS. In front of the tiny pupil of the eye
        they put, on Mount Palomar, a great monocle 200 inches in diameter, and with it see 2000 times farther into the
        depths of space. Or they look through a small pair of lenses arranged as a microscope into a drop of water or
        blood, and magnify by as much as 2000 diameters the living creatures there, many of which are among man’s most
        dangerous enemies. Or, if we want to see distant happenings on earth, they use some of the previously wasted
        electromagnetic waves to carry television images which they re-create as light by whipping tiny crystals on a
        screen with electrons in a vacuum. Or they can bring happenings of long ago and far away as colored motion
        pictures, by arranging silver atoms and color-absorbing molecules to force light waves into the patterns of
        original reality. Or if we want to see into the center of a steel casting or the chest of an injured child, they
        send the information on a beam of penetrating short-wave X rays, and then convert it back into images we can see
        on a screen or photograph. THUS ALMOST EVERY TYPE OF ELECTROMAGNETIC RADIATION YET DISCOVERED HAS BEEN USED TO
        EXTEND OUR SENSE OF SIGHT IN SOME WAY.

        n a coherent paragraph, each sentence relates clearly to the topic sentence or controlling idea, but there is
        more to coherence than this. If a paragraph is coherent, each sentence flows smoothly into the next without
        obvious shifts or jumps. A coherent paragraph also highlights the ties between old information and new
        information to make the structure of ideas or arguments clear to the reader.

        Along with the smooth flow of sentences, a paragraph’s coherence may also be related to its length. If you have
        written a very long paragraph, one that fills a double-spaced typed page, for example, you should check it
        carefully to see if it should start a new paragraph where the original paragraph wanders from its controlling
        idea. On the other hand, if a paragraph is very short (only one or two sentences, perhaps), you may need to
        develop its controlling idea more thoroughly, or combine it with another paragraph.

        A number of other techniques that you can use to establish coherence in paragraphs are described below.

        Repeat key words or phrases. Particularly in paragraphs in which you define or identify an important idea or
        theory, be consistent in how you refer to it. This consistency and repetition will bind the paragraph together
        and help your reader understand your definition or description.

        Create parallel structures. Parallel structures are cren a coherent paragraph, each sentence relates clearly to
